# Endless Online Patcher ðŸŒ™

This is a tool for patching [Endless Online](https://endless-online.com) because the developers were so rude as to come back after 10+ years and start working on it again ðŸ˜‚

# How it works

This tool fetches the latest page from the [official client download page](https://www.endless-online.com/client/download.html) and uses a regular expression to extract the version of the game client and compares it to what you have installed locally. 

This tool gets the installed location of Endless online either by checking the parent folder to the tool (e.g. This tool would install to `Endless Online/Patcher` if you were to use the installer provided) or if there is no Endless.exe in the parent folder, it defaults to `C:/Program Files (x86)/Endless Online/` as the install directory for the game.

If your local version is older than the most recent version according to the client download page, then you will get the option to patch which will download the .zip archive of the latest version, extract it to a temporary directory, and then copy all the files across to the install location (except the config) and then give you the option to launch the game.

# Features
